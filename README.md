Travel on two is a adventure bicycle touring blog platform

The idea behind it is I my self have gone on a couple of long distance bike trips, but there really is no central website for everything bicycle touring. My dream is to one day make this website much more then simply a blogging platform, but for now that's all I really can do.

A general User story would go
- Make an account
- Make a blog
- Make a post for that blog
- Look at other people's blogs and journerys

You could also not make an account and simply search not make an account and view a blog

Some seeds are given simply run a db:setup to get everything going.
